First of all I will train the model from the scratch. I'll use convolutional neural network on 2000 items without regularization. This will create a reference point. Then, I'll use data augmentation to increase accuracy of the model.

Processing on MacBook Pro 15 2018

## Will be updated shortly on RTX3080
